# Breast-cancer Segmentation

## Description :

**Breast-Cancer Segmentation** using  a fine-tuned Segment Anything Model (SAM) called **Breast-Cancer_SAM_v1** https://huggingface.co/ayoubkirouane/Breast-Cancer_SAM_v1 is a project that aims to develop a fine-tuned SAM model for the segmentation of breast cancer tumors in medical images. The project uses the Breast Cancer Segmentation Dataset (BCSD), which is a publicly available dataset of breast cancer images with corresponding segmentation masks.

## Base Model:
**The Segment Anything Model (SAM)** is a state-of-the-art deep learning model for image segmentation. SAM is a vision transformer-based model that has been shown to achieve excellent performance on a variety of natural image segmentation tasks.


## The project would involve the following steps:

* Collecting a dataset of breast cancer images. This dataset should include images with a variety of tumor types and sizes, as well as images with different types of noise and artifacts.
* Annotating the tumor regions in the images. This can be done manually by a medical expert, or using a semi-automatic annotation tool.
* Fine-tuning a SAM model on the annotated dataset. This can be done using the segment_anything library.
* Evaluating the performance of the trained model on a held-out test set. This is important to ensure that the model is able to generalize to new data.
* Deploying the trained model to a clinical setting. This could involve developing a web-based application or a plugin for a medical imaging software package.
